Before we get started: there are three other really great talks happening right now, including the Personal OSINT talk by Nadine Whitfield in 3178, so I’m not gonna feel bad if you bail now (or at any point). 

Let me get this out of the way right up front: there are no “non-technical” jobs in the modern world. Every position in a modern company, from facilities coordinator to Principal Architect, requires specialist information and skills. The term “technical” creates an artificial boundary between the “important” people and the “non-important” people, but in a modern company there aren’t any non-important people. 

One of my “live-by” quotes is from Cory Doctorow: “The default state of technology is ‘broken’.”


Some jobs that are considered “non-technical” by “technical” people:
Sales
Accounting
Facilities
Front-desk
Exec assistant
HR
Account management
Project management
Manager
Technical Writer
VP / CTO

Some jobs that are considered “technical” by “technical” people:
Junior developer
build/release engineer
Systems administrator (sometimes?)
Database administrator
Senior developer
Principal developer 
Tech Lead
System Architect

Some people who are “not technical enough”:
Developer lacking in specific toolset experience
Junior developer pursuing a promotion
Operations professional looking to move into development
Manager moving back into an individual contributor role
A woman
A non-white person
A person from another career path looking to get into development

So what do we mean when we say someone is “not technical” in relation to a specific role, or when a particular task is “too technical” for a given person?
The particular knowledge of a specific technology may not be present or may not be deep enough from appearance and from the outside
That we (whomever we are) don’t think, in our experience and using our judgement, that the person in question is a mismatch for the role in question for reasons outside of explicit measuring.
That “technical” is a measure of importance that relies solely on criteria that are mostly, but not entirely, dependent on how close one is to the role of “developer” in the company.


There are no “non-technical” jobs in the modern world. A front-desk person at a moderate-to-large company has as many runbooks as your average junior developer/admin.

Show of hands: who here is familiar with infosec? OK, second show of hands: who here knows what the number one threat vector is for infosec failures? OK, pick one person, what is it? The answer is: social engineering -- getting to a person who has access, and getting them to give it to you. 

Quick pop quiz: you are sitting at the front desk, covering a bathroom break, say. The phone rings and the person on the other end of the line says they’re Agent Siler with the IRS and they need to talk to the CFO. What do you do? It’s the IRS, and it’s really important! Or how about this one: a person comes to the front desk and shows you their badge: they are from the FBI. They have a Warrant. What do you do? Who needs to see the Warrant? How do you know the Warrant is even valid? 

Per AT&T, the average switchboard operator (98% of whom were women) received between 10 and 18 weeks of training before being allowed to work without 100% supervision; what’s the mean-time-to-commit for your new developer hire?

Here’s a question for you about accounting and bookkeeping: who knows what EBITA means? 

EBITDA is Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization, it’s an efficiency measurement against a company’s operational profitability. Crucially, it INCLUDES equipment (capital expenditure, or capex) costs, but EXCLUDES financing (leveraged, or loan) costs. Some folks who have spent time in a startup understand the idea of “burn rate”: which is the amount of cash on hand divided by the amount spent per unit of time, which gives a rough margin for how much longer the company can continue to operate. EBITDA is roughly what “burn rate” is for companies who have other financing means than Venture Capital (though some VC-backed companies also use EBITDA). Note that EBITDA is different crucially for EBITA, which does NOT take into account depreciation of assets! 

Does anyone here have experience with Gantt charts? Henry Gantt put his name on the harmonogram around 1910, which is a visual representation of a project in flight and the expected coordination of separate tasks or sets of tasks on a timeline basis. Agile teams HATE Gantt charts, because they’re part of “deadlines rather than deliverables” as a concept. But social media and outreach teams LOVE Gantt charts, because they make marketing campaigns much easier to manage. Marketing campaigns are the tip of the spear on how tech companies make money (or, at least in theory make money). 

Salesforce is a gigantic company with a really, really big toolset that lots and lots of people like and use. And even more people who use it but don’t like it! But the thing that Salesforce is designed to do is manage sales cycles. The general term for this is Customer Relationship Management, and it’s a whole enormous thing. And CRMs are highly-complicated pieces of software that salespeople use on a daily basis. The idea that the people who use Salesforce software in the way that it was designed to be used are “not technical” is fundamentally indefensible.

SMART objectives come directly from sales organizations: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Cycle-time, Leads, Customer acquisition costs, churn rate.

So now that we have determined that all modern roles are, in some way, technical then we can recognize that there are opportunities to expand the philosophy of DevOps to teams that are outside the traditional duality of Development and Operations. Turns out, eliminating the hierarchy allows for effective and efficient work to be done, and for people to be recompensed fairly for that work!

Before we can expand the philosophy of DevOps, we have to determine what DevOps actually is. Spoiler Alert: no one knows. Or, rather, everyone knows that they have a particular take on the DevOps philosophy, and some of them will try very hard to sell it to you (or your coworkers, or your boss, or your C-level executives). And like many philosophies, what works for you is the important part, not whether the entirety of the sacred texts can be agreed upon. But since I’m the one with the slide deck, I’ll go ahead and lay out what *I* think the key factors of the DevOps philosophy are, and how they can be leveraged to connect you closer to those other teams and how that’s a good thing for everyone, including you. 

The Five Key Insights of the DevOps philosophy as I’ve come to understand them are this:
Simplicity, Automation and Processing, Continuous Improvement, A focus on the Customer, and Relational Thinking. But what the fuck does any of that mean?

Simplicity: breaking your environment down into the simplest-possible, most-atomic functions is key to both understanding and improving the way all of the interconnected complexity happens. This is as true in HR or Documentation as it is in the production environment, or your unit tests, or your ansible runbook. Once you understand the simple stuff, you can grow, and change, how those simple things interact. On the obverse side of this, recognizing complexity for complexity’s sake, and committing to simplification, is key to improving at every level. If there is a fantastically complex and annoying process for, say, filing expense reports, or requesting a new monitor for your workstation, then it may be worthwhile to ask “why” and work with the group in question to try and strive for simplicity. But we also want to avoid reductivisim (note: I’m rereading Marx’s Capital and he talks about reducing complexity beyond the point of reality to infer understanding instead of imparting understanding). Practical Example: Error Messages

Automation and Processing: A process is simply a series of steps to complete a unit of work. A runbook is a process. An escalation tree is a process. A feedback loop between a customer and an account manager is a process, even if they aren’t codified or explicitly written down. But it is always worthwhile to write them down! Because by writing down a process, we can identify where that process can then be automated. If the billing department needs a notification at the beginning of every month of the per-unit utilization of your app widget, then the first step is to figure out the process of generating that report, and the SECOND step is to automate the shit out of it. And if you can automate YOUR interaction with AP/AR, then there’s a very good chance you can help them (and the other teams they work with) to automate ALL of those interactions, which will make them very happy and you very popular! Practical Example: Customer Feedback / status alerts

Continuous Improvement: there is no point in the development of an application, service, or environment where everything is “done”. If there were, Google wouldn’t have killed so many great tools. In order to keep both ourselves and our customers engaged and interested, we must always continue to improve the tools we have, and the things we build with those tools. This is as true in the understanding of infosec and how that relates to the front desk person’s grasp of social engineering as it is in the latest release of docker or the most popular IDE. Recognizing that by continually revisiting the existing processes and automations in order to refine and improve them, we help both ourselves and our fellow travelers. By doing this, we bring value above and beyond the money spent or time saved. Practical example: DOCS!

A Focus on the Customer: As an avowed anticapitalist, I’m aware of the rank hypocrisy of my emphasis on this point, but bear with me. As we live in a Capitalist society where we exchange labor for currency, which we then in turn exchange for goods and services, the fact is that understanding the value of the customer is paramount. It’s also important to the philosophy of DevOps that we understand who the customer is, and the answer is “everyone we interact with”. As the stakeholders and caretakers of the Money Engine (aka the production environment), it is not enough that we consider the people who give us their currency. We must also understand that ANYONE we interact with, anyone with whom we have a relationship that requires our input and therefore our labor is de facto a customer of ours. That includes Corporate IT / Facilities. That includes HR and the front desk person. That includes, indeed, accounting and account management and sales: they are our customers, as much as we are their customers. Like it or not, Capitalism makes all of us part of the Service Economy, and the faster we recognize that, the better off we’ll be. Practical example: Ops Chargeback!

Relational Thinking: No thing exists atomically. The function written without a call is a priori non-functional. So it is important to recognise that things exist in relation to other things. Likewise, it is important to realize that people exist in relation to other people, and therefore everyone has a relationship to one another. Some of those relationships are clear, like the administrator of your company’s AD setup. Some of them are unclear, like who reports to the CFO. Some of them are temporary, like who’s in your family. Some of them are permanent, like who your ex-husband is. But we all exist in relationships with each other, and it’s worthwhile to both consider what sort of relationships you’d prefer to have, and how to maintain those relationships both personally and professionally. Practical example: Technical Support!

Conclusion:

Aubrey Blanche is a developer with Atlassian. 

DevOps is about creating community, connections, and cooperation within and without various organizations to help everyone recognize that, in fact, we are all working together, supporting each other in mutual benefit. So creating artificial hierarchies that negatively impact that mutuality only hurts the organization, not to mention the individuals that make up the organization and work together. It is therefore important for those of us who have the ability to act as gatekeepers to instead work as portal providers: to make sure the gates are open. That we recognize that 1) not everyone needs to work in DevOps to be considered “important”, and 2) everyone who wants to work in DevOps may not have a traditional background (and probably doesn’t look like me). We need to reexamine the reason we use the word “technical” to separate groups, and what we are ACTUALLY trying to say.
