The thing about the Star Wars canon is that, because it's mostly movies and toys, the idea of "canon" just doesn't hold any water. It's like Dr. Who -- the reality (within the show/movie) is "whatever the writer needs it to be". As someone who as read a LOT of Science Fiction series, and who counts a a favourite a book series that's 28 years and 21 books long (and counting!) I have a particular fondness for KEEPING THINGS STRAIGHT. And Star Wars has been especially good at... just not doing that. "All of the movies are canon!" Motherfucker, there are at least three places in the nonology[^1] where a movie contradicts itself.
