F1_Manager_Thoughts

So I've played F1 Manager 2022 for 30 hours now, and I have a _lot_ of thoughts on the game. So I'm going to write a bunch down here. 

F1  Manager 2022 is the latest (branded) game in the "Sport Management" sim line that is nearly dominated by Codemasters, a development team who focuses on these sorts of games: Motorsport Manager, Football Manager, etc. Games where instead of playing the game (like the F1 racing series, or the FIFA series) instead you are put in the position of being a team manager, making decisions about staffing, talent, facilities, budgets, etc. It's a pretty niche kind of game, but if you like that kind of thing then you're likely already familiar with Codemasters as a developer. Codemasters was bought by EA last year, and consequently instead of a generic car game we got a branded, FIA-approved version, because EA holds the F1 license (but ONLY the F1 license, which is actually important, and arguably a problem). 

The TL;DR review is: do you play Motorsport Manager? Keep playing that. Have you not played one of these Manager games before? This is probably a good start for you then.

To back up a bit: Motorsport Manager was published by Codemasters back in 2016. A couple of DLCs were added not long after, but mostly it's lain fallow for the duration. There are three race "classes" you can manage: an F1-style class with the serial numbers filed off; a GT series which is _kinda_ like NASCAR, and an Endurance series (think Le Mans or other 24/12 hour races). Because it wasn't officially licensed for anything, the developers had a lot of fun with not just the advertising and team names, but also with how everything interacted -- it was not just possible but expected for a player to offer bribes to the governing body of the series to get rules changed, for instance -- and because they had lots of leeway they could add in more women drivers, engineers, and team leads. Of course, it took modders about 15 seconds to put F1-brand stuff back into the game (as well as Formula Porche among other seies) and 8 years on the mods community (including at least two different full-game-rework versions) is still going strong -- there was recently a mid-season update to F1 driver capabilities based on actual driving results -- and the people who love and play Motorsport Manager are still having a blast with it. 

F1 Manager 2022 seems to be an indicator that we'll be getting one of these every year (the same as we get a new F1 driving game every year) and one of the things I'm really hoping is that we'll get some incremental improvements as things go forward, in the same way we see Football Manager improve from year to year. There are a ton of recognizable mechanics in F1 Manager that came out of Motorsport Manager, but there's also a significant number of things simply _missing_ in F1 Manager. The familiar driver management minigames are there: if you ever wanted to micromanage a driver to get the best racing setup, or the fastest qualifier lap, or making calls about tyre types and pit strategies during the race, then you'll enjoy F1 Manager. 

But if you want to see your HQ property, you're out of luck. The facilities are there to buy or upgrade (or, newly, refurbish) but you are never shown the actual buildings, rooms, or equipment. It's just a box on the screen that you click to make the numbers go up. The camera angles and map assets are terrible; they focus very hard on making the game look like a TV show, but as a manager I don't want to see TV camera angles, I want to see where my car is on the track and follow them around. Motorsport Manager (and indeed F1 22) is really great for this, so it's disappointing to see the terrible choices that were made here. Also, because it's a licensed F1 property, there's no option except for the F1 open-wheel racing (and NO option to manage F2, F3, or any other type of car). I mean, to be fair, it is called "F1 Manager", but still, this is a full priced game that has a third of the content of a game made 8 years ago. The graphics (especially the on-track cars) are very very pretty, and the drivers and staff are all actual pictured people instead of cartoon portraits, but pretty in this case doesn't really balance out content. 

In addition, because it's F1, there are ONLY men available for the various roles. There is absolutely no option to get staff or drivers from other series; not even W-series, the all-woman open-wheel series associated with F1, have drivers that are available for hire. There are woman models for the random staffers in the pit row or in the office, but none of the hire-able staff are women. There's also a _space_ in the profile page that looks like you can upload a photo, but there's no way to actually upload that picture for your profile. Maybe this isn't a big deal for others, but as a woman fan of F1, I've often prioritized finding and promoting women in my games, and to be told by an official F1 game that women are not welcome is hugely disappointing. 

Of course all of these things are effectively nitpicks. F1 Manager 2022 is very much a modern reworking of Motorsport Manager, and the bones of a great game are there under the flashy graphics and realistic photos. And it's entirely possible that the driver market problem could be fixed simply with a DLC, for instance. I could easily imagine a content patch for the facilities renders that borrows assets from F1 22 (they already do that with the animations from the pit lane) and offers more options for visualizations (I'd _love_ to be able to pick the circle-style track maps that actual pro managers use). 

I'm an avowed F1 fan. I watch all three free practices, all three qualifying sessions, as well as the actual race. I've been known to watch F2 and F3 races to get familiar with the next group of drivers. So the experience of shepherding drivers through race weekends for multiple seasons is my idea of fun. And if you haven't tried it before, F1 Manager is actually a pretty good intro to the management sim game; lots of guardrails and shortcuts, with the ability to add things back in as you become more comfortable with the game. But if you're not an explicit F1 fan, I'm not comfortable recommending you buy this game now; I'd say wait and see if there are any content patches or DLC. If you're hard-core, Motorsport Manager is going to be a more interesting, more complete experience. But if you love F1 and have always wanted to be Toto Wolff (or Gunther Steiner) then F1 Manager 2022 is the game.
