# How Do I Get A Job In IT?

I've been asked this question a couple of times by a couple of people, so I figured I'd write up my scattered thoughts in one place to be more comprehensive and also more comprehensible. Or, I suppose, at least collected.

Some caveats before I begin. First, I have absolutely no idea what the job market looks like from the perspective of someone searching for a job. I'm a manager, which means mostly what I do is look around for people to hire. Second, management is an entirely different _industry_ when compared to Individual Contributer rolls in IT. I haven't been an IC for a while, and given how much I love managing, I probably won't go back to IC work unless I'm desperate. So all of my views on this are either from a person-who-is-hiring perspective, or second-hand info from others. Third, I've been working in IT forever, basically; my path to success in the Tech Industry is basically non-repeatable at this point [^1]. But if I were young and/or looking for a new gig that paid well, this is probably the path I would take.

Another Point: IT is an industry. Programming or Operations roles are a _job_, not some sort of holy calling. Wanting a job in IT because it's where we keep the money these days is a perfectly reasonable motivation for trying to get into the industry. Are there people who are passionate about their work? Sure! But it's not a prerequisite. It's also not required that you be brilliant at it; the myth of the solo genius programmer is, and always has been, a myth. You can make a decent living being entirely adequate at coding. 

Last thing before the meat of this rant: despite the fact that it is terrible, the absolute best way to get a job in IT is to know someone who can either hire you or recommend you to someone else as a hire. The tech industry (at least here in the US) is extremely white and male, which means Old Boy Networks. The best thing you can do for yourself is get to know people. The good news is, tech is getting less white and less male, and it's getting _way_ more queer. So there is probably a niche for you, too, whomever you may be. [^2]

## So what WOULD I do?

There's two answers to this question, though there is some overlap between them. Are you young? Or are you changing industries? Either of these is much more possible than they used to be. 

## I'm just starting my career-search, and have no / very little experience in the workforce

If this is you: go to your nearest community college and enroll immediately for as many classes as you can take without killing yourself. If they offer it, get into the IT focus track and connect yourself with the resources available to you as a student. I would recommend against a code school or boot camp or something like that, especially if they're charging college-level prices; I am not currently aware of _any_ code schools that have _any_ sort of accreditation as an educational institution. If you're looking to get something real for your time and money, CCs are the single greatest resource you can leverage. The thing about Community College is that the only people in CC classes are the people that came to _learn_. They don't have time for partying and bullshit. They're also often people who have at least one full-time job, so you will find that the teachers are usually much more understanding about available time. 

As far as what coding language you should choose, there's a lot of "new hotness" churn in programming, so that's a bit of a moving target. It's much more important that you accrue the ability to abstract ideas and break down processes into discreet repeatable steps. Which language you do it in is almost optional. That said, there's a few things I'd encourage you to focus on. From an extremely broad point of vew, there are basically two kinds [^3] of computer languages: scripting languages, and programming languages. You should probably know at least one of each. For scripting languages, the big three are python, bash, and perl---that covers about 90% of the current internet---and any of them will be useful. For programming languages, you have more choices, but I would recommend these specifics: for modern languages, Java. It's terrible, everyone hates it, and half the current programs in the world are written in it. You would probably also be well-served to learn C, specifically C++ ("See Plus Plus") or C# ("See Sharp"). I would also HIGHLY recommend that if possible you learn COBOL or FORTRAN. By internet standards, these are ancient languages, but a big chunk of government and financial technology is built in these two languages, and all of the people who knew how to program those languages are retiring. There's a big demand right now for COBOL especially, and almost no one to fill it. 

One last thing: the IT industry seems to think that it's somehow special or revolutionary in some ineffable way that means that the people who work in IT must be exemplary in some way. I can assure you this is not true. Capitalism works the same everywhere. Gates are for logic, not keeping. [^4]

## I have some / significant job experience in other industries, but would like to be paid fairly for my labor

Because people who work with computers are absolutely ridiculous in their obsession with Three-Letter Acronyms, and are also astoundingly bad at naming things, the industry term for someone who had a career before working in IT is known as an NTB, or non-traditional background. [^5] There are a couple of things that make this jump a little harder: there is enormous age bias in IT, and there is significant amounts of the Dunning-Kruger effect on display. If you're looking to be an IC of some kind, I recommend much of the above advice, including learning COBOL or FORTRAN. But often the real value of NTBs is the ability to bring a little reality to situations that are frequently lacking in it. If you have had a career (or even just a job) with exposure to real people [^6] and  Things As They Are, rather than As We Want Them To Be, that can go a long way to obviating other concerns or reservations. In addition, another benefit of an NTB is the ability to say "I have a proven track record in X" where X is something like meeting deadlines, managing people, dealing with teams, or the like. IT is _starved_ for decent managers; the current model of 'promoting the best programmer to lead the team' just ends up with a bunch of managers who both hate their job AND are terrible at it. 

## So what does that mean?

There is no canonical "way" into a career in IT [^7]; every person's journey will be different. That said, it's a numbers game -- keep applying, keep networking, keep learning stuff. As long as we're all stuck in this Capitalist hellscape, you might as well get paid well. 


[^1]: I was a cis white dude in San Francisco in the mid-90s, and a guy in my D&D group offered to recommend me for a job. 

[^2]: There is a joke going around that the entire backbone of the internet is maintained by gay furries with BDSM fetishes and while this is _slightly_ overstated, it's close enough to the truth to be encouraging.

[^3]: this is, of course, a _gross_ oversimplification of the actual ecosystem, but if nothing else IT is really good at drawing an ever-more-complicated cladistic model of the universe.

[^4]: This is a computer science joke that perhaps five people on the entire planet will find funny. 

[^5]: It is perhaps deliberately vague what, exactly, a "traditional background" is for a person who works in IT; and besides, it's all bullshit anyway.

[^6]: As opposed to the made-up people that are supposed to represent users of various software features, all of whom bear little-to-no resemblance to the actual behaviour of actual human beings.

[^7]: The exception being "getting a job reccomendation/opportunity from a friend", which seems to be the most significant commonality of anyone I've ever spoken to in the industry.
